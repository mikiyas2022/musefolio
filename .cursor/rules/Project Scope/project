Build a scalable, modular platform where users create profession-specific portfolios with AI-guided design. Prioritize a frictionless editor (like Wix but niche-focused), dynamic CV/portfolio sync, and subdomain flexibility. Ensure cross-platform responsiveness and integrate key learnings from UXFolio (case studies) and Dribbble (visual polish). Include GDPR compliance, SSO options

MuseFolio is a dynamic, all-in-one platform for professionals to create, customize, and publish polished CVs and portfolios. It combines AI-driven template suggestions (tailored to professions like software development, graphic design, architecture, etc.), deep customization (layouts, themes, UX), and dynamic content management (projects, CV fields, media). Users register, input professional details, and instantly publish their portfolio on a custom subdomain (e.g., john.musefolio.com or johndoe.com via domain mapping).
